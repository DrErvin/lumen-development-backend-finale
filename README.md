# Ekipa Project - Student Platform (Backend)

This is the backend server for the Ekipa-Student Platform, developed in collaboration with Deutsche Telekom. It provides APIs for managing user accounts, job opportunities, applications, and AI-powered smart search.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Prerequisites

For this project to function correctly, you must have the following:

**1. A Separate Frontend Repository**

- Instructions on how to run and set up the frontend are available in its README file.

### üîß Project Setup (Backend)

**1. Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, clone this repository and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/DrErvin/Student_platform_server.git
cd Student_platform_server
npm install

```

**2. Start the Backend Server**

‚úÖ Recommended: Stable Production-Like Mode

- To run the backend server without restarts on file changes (best for testing and production-like usage), use:

- ```
  npm start
  ```

- This ensures that server restarts are controlled and prevents interruptions due to file changes.

‚ö†Ô∏è Development Mode (Optional)

- For live-reloading during development, use:

- ```
  npm run dev
  ```

- This automatically restarts the server when files change.
  However, it can be unstable and cause issues with ongoing requests.
